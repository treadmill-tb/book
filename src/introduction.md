# Welcome to the Treadmill Testbed Book!

This book is the primary documentation of the Treadmill Testbed
project, software and hardware. It is divided up into the following
main chapters:

1. [**The User Guide**](user-guide.md): start here if you are new to Treadmill
   and you want to run interactive development sessions or use it to run some
   automated Continuous Integration workloads.

2. [**Documentation of public Treadmill deployments**](deployments.md): this
   chapter documents individual deployments (*sites*) that are connected to the
   main Treadmill Switchboard instance (`swx.treadmill.ci`). You can find the
   available hardware resources and documentation of the individual setups here.

3. [**The Operator's Guide**](operator_guide.md): This chapter contains guides
   and other useful information for operators of the Treadmill switchboard or
   site deployments.

4. [**Internals**](internals.md): Documentation of the components that make up
   Treadmill, such as the switchboard, puppet, or supervisor crates.
